# Air-Quality-Prediction-Model
This Python-based project leverages machine learning to predict air quality levels using synthetic pollutant data, simulating real-world air quality monitoring for various pollutants.
The Air Quality Prediction application forecasts air quality metrics based on past data for critical pollutants, including CO₂, NO₂, SO₂, and PM2.5. By using a machine learning model, this project enables users to gain insights into air quality trends and predict future AQI (Air Quality Index) values, which are essential for environmental health monitoring.
